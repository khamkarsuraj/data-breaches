            <p>Background</p>
            <p>
                Data breaches can have a variety of effects. Breached organizations may incur significant costs to remedy the damage,
                such as correcting system flaws, paying out compensation to victims, and settling legal claims. Rebuilding the harmed 
                people and the violated organization's trust comes at a hidden cost that is difficult to quantify. Individuals affected 
                are at risk of identity theft, account breach, and phishing due to exposed data. Even while it could take years before 
                leaked data is utilized improperly, the damage can be severe. For instance, identity theft victims may have damaged 
                credit records or be forced to file for bankruptcy due to credit misuse. In a 2017 Identity Theft Resource Center poll, 
                77% of respondents experienced higher stress levels, and 55% expressed higher exhaustion or less energy. Identity theft 
                is also traumatic.

                Consequently, some academics have suggested that data breaches result in compensable losses because of the victims' 
                mental pain and the significant danger of future financial injury. Laws usually require breached businesses to compensate 
                victims with discounts or free credit/identity monitoring in addition to notifying those impacted. Services that analyze 
                reports of third-party breaches and advise subscribers include HIBP and Firefox Monitor. Some businesses reset passwords 
                automatically for users whose login information was revealed in password leaks. Additional safety measures for victims 
                include warnings about phishing and social engineering scams and two-factor authentication (2FA), making it more challenging 
                to utilize stolen credentials. However, no system is perfect: phishing alerts are seldom heeded, and attackers can bypass 
                2FA without obtaining the backup token.
